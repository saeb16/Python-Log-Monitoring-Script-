Features of the Code:
Log Monitoring: The script monitors a log file (/var/log/server.log) for patterns such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access, and repeated requests.
Regular Expressions: It uses regular expressions to identify patterns in log entries, making it flexible and easy to modify for various monitoring purposes.
Alert System: If suspicious activity is found, the script sends an alert email to the admin using Pythonâ€™s smtplib library.
Real-Time Detection: The script is capable of running periodically to provide real-time monitoring for critical logs, making it suitable for both Cyber Security and DevOps operations.
Use Case:
This script could be extended in DevOps pipelines for automated security monitoring, or as part of a larger system for detecting unusual behavior in a cloud environment. It provides a great starting point for introducing students to both automation in DevOps and log analysis in Cyber Security.
